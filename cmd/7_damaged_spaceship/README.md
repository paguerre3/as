To publish your Docker image to Docker Hub, follow these steps:

### 1. **Login to Docker Hub from Your Terminal**
You need to log in to Docker Hub through the command line interface (CLI). Use the following command to log in:

```bash
docker login
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

### 2. **Tag Your Docker Image IF NOT "already done" in Docker Compose**
Before you can push an image to Docker Hub, you need to tag it with your Docker Hub username and repository name. The tag follows the format:

```
<your-docker-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
```

For example, if your Docker Hub username is `pablo` and you want to name your repository `my-go-app`, tag the image like this:

```bash
docker tag my-go-app pablo/my-go-app:latest
```

If you don’t specify a tag, Docker will automatically assume `latest` as the default tag.

### 3. **Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**
Now, you can push the tagged image to Docker Hub using the `docker push` command:

```bash
docker push pablo/my-go-app:latest
```

This will upload your Docker image to Docker Hub. The upload process may take some time, depending on the size of your image and your internet connection.

### 4. **Verify the Image on Docker Hub**
Once the push is complete, go to your Docker Hub account, and you should see the image in your repositories list under the name `my-go-app`.

### 5. **Pull the Docker Image (to verify)**
To verify the image has been successfully pushed, you can pull the image from Docker Hub on any machine using the following command:

```bash
docker pull pablo/my-go-app:latest
```

This will pull the image to your local machine, confirming it's available on Docker Hub.

### Additional Notes:
- **Repository Visibility**: Make sure your Docker Hub repository is set to **Public** if you want others to access it. By default, repositories are private for new users.
- **Pushing Large Images**: If your image is large, Docker will use layers to upload the image in parts. This is normal.
